# Algorithms for Threat Detection 2025

Welcome to the ATD 2025 challenge!

In this challenge, you will construct ship tracks from observations that only include a ship’s
position and velocity at a given time, but no information about the ship’s identity.

You will work with publicly
available [Automatic Identification System (AIS) data](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/ais.html)
that has been stripped of identifying information and subsampled.

This package includes example datasets to assist you in your training and testing. It also has
utilities to download and create datasets for other time periods.

## Getting Started
