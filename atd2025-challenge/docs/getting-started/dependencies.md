# Install Mamba

To participate in this year's challenge, you will need to install `mamba`.

`mamba` is package and environment management system (that is a drop-in replacement for `conda`). We will use it to create the `atd2025` development environment.

To install `mamba`, follow the installation instructions available here [https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html).

!!! Note

    You are welcome to use `conda` if you already have it installed. However, `mamba` tends to be faster.
